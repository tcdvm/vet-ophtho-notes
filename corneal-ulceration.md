# Corneal Ulceration

A lesion of the cornea that is a result of the loss of corneal epithelium +/- loss of stroma.

In cases of corneal ulceration, you need to assess the ulcer for 4 things:  
1. Etiology of the ulcer – THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE EVALUATION! If there is a removable etiology and you don’t resolve it, the ulcer will not heal!  
2. Depth of the ulcer – Is it superficial, into the stroma, down to Descemet’s membrane, or completely perforated?  
3. Presence of either of 2 “complicating factors”: infection or matrix metalloproteinases. 7  
4. Rate of progression \(i.e., is it deepening, and, if so, how quickly?\) – Often can’t determine this at the first evaluation, other than to say if MMP activity is present. If there is MMP activity the ulcer will progress \(i.e., deepen\) very quickly if you don’t intervene.

Associated clinical signs:

Blepharospasm – squinting. Pain from corneal ulcers has 2 sources. The first is the corneal itself – the cornea is richly innervated by sensory fibers of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The second is the ciliary body. The axons of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve send branches off into uveal tissue, where release of neurotransmitters \(primarily a neuropeptide called “substance P”\) causes, among other things, ciliary body spasm. Ciliary spasm is very painful \(ciliary spasm also occurs when you go from a darkened room into bright light\). This phenomenon of corneal injury causing ciliary spasm via ophthalmic branch axons is termed “axon reflex.”

Epiphora – excessive tearing. Tears are produced by the main lacrimal gland and gland of the third eyelid, and drained by the nasolacrimal duct. Epiphora can be caused by overproduction in response to painful stimuli \(such as that seen with a corneal ulcer\) or by diminished drainage.

Corneal edema and corneal vascularization as described above.

## Diagnostics:

Fluorescein stain is the diagnostic modality of choice. Fluorescein is a water soluble dye. Fluorescein is hydrophilic so it is taken up by the stroma; Descemet’s membrane and the epithelium are lipophilic. Because the corneal epithelium is lipophilic and hydrophobic \(thus preventing transcellular passage of fluorescein\) and contains very robust interepithelial tight junctions \(preventing paracellular passage of fluorescein\), fluorescein applied to the cornea will simply run off the surface and not adhere. When the epithelium is denuded, the underlying hydrophilic stroma is exposed. The ulcer will appear green which is accentuated with a cobalt blue filter. When using the strip moisten the end and either drip the solution on the cornea or touch the wet tip to the conjunctiva and rinse with saline.

## Causes of corneal ulcers

1. Trauma
2. Eyelash abnormalities – distichia, ectopica cilia
3. Eyelid abnormalities – entropion, eyelid tumors
4. Foreign bodies
5. Dry eye
6. Indolent ulcers



1. Trauma: History of exposure to other pets, flora, alkali, shampoo, mace, shape of ulcer.
    * Treatment
        * Prevent infection: Use a broad spectrum antibiotic such as triple antibiotic TID-QID
        * Treat pain due to ciliary spasm: Use atropine to effect usually BID-QID
2. Eyelash abnormalities
    * Distichia: Cilia originating from the tarsal gland, emanating from tarsal gland opening on eyelid margin. These do not always cause an ulcer but may prevent one from healing. Some distichia are present without causing disease. Especially common in cockers, dachshunds and poodles.
        * Treatment
            * Freeze with a double freeze thaw cycle with liquid nitrogen or nitrous oxide. Other less recommended therapies are electroepilation and excision. The distichia can be pulled as a temporary solution to help determine significance. More may grow or the treated ones may come back. All distichia do not need need to be treated as many are asymptomatic.
    * Ectopic cilia: Cilia originating from tarsal gland that emanate from palpebral conjunctiva. May not occur until middle age. With magnification look about 4 mm in from eyelid margin, these can be very difficult to see. They are usually at 12 o’clock upper lid.
        * Treatment
            * Excise cilia en bloc from conjunctiva. Warn owners that more may grow. Look closely for more ectopic cilia when the animal is anesthetized.
    * Entropion: In turning of eyelid margin that results in hairs rubbing the cornea. Entropion can be strictly conformational, spastic or cicatricial; this must be determined during the examination.
        * Conformational is due to a disproportionate size of orbit and globe position. Seen most commonly in Shar peis, rottweilers, Chows, bulldogs. These do not correct with topical anesthesia. Involutional is an acquired conformational entropion that occurs secondary to loss of orbital tissue.
        * Spastic entropion occurs secondary to ocular pain such as that from an ulcer. The pain causes the dog to retract the globe thereby allowing the eyelids to roll in. This does correct with topical anesthesia.
        * Cicatricial entropion occurs when chronically spastic tissue scars rolled in or secondary to scar formation from trauma.
        * Puppy entropion occurs in Shar Pei puppies. This is not treated surgically; rather 2-3 temporary tacking vertical mattress sutures are placed to roll out the lid. I use 4-0 or 5-0 vicryl and let it fall out on its own. If you can get these sutures to stay in for 2-3 weeks, the lids will often remain in a more normal position meaning that permanent (i.e., Hotz-Celsus) correction won’t be needed. A pragmatic problem to appreciate in these cases is that due to the abnormal subdermal tissue in Shar Peis the sutures often tear out before they’ve been in long enough (often in a few days). The only recommendation if this happens is to replace them...just be sure to warn your owners that it could happen when you put in the first set of sutures so they’re not surprised!
        * Ophthalmic examination including STT and fluorescein must be done. The eyes must be examined with and without topical anesthetic.
        * Treatment
            * Modified Holz Celsus. This procedure can be applied to any area of the eyelid - lateral, middle, upper, lower, complete. Treat any secondary ulcers medically or surgically as indicated. When suturing the crescent we use 5-0 or 6-0 vicryl as the tags are soft if they contact the cornea.
            * With spastic entropion treat the primary cause, +/- tacking , contact lens, third eyelid flaps.
3. Eyelid mass: Tumors and infections of the eyelid margin can rub the cornea leading to ulceration.
    * Treatment: See eyelid section
4. Foreign body: May present as a bump on the cornea if the foreign body is embedded, or it
may become lodged behind the third eyelid.
    * Treatment
        * Usually can remove the foreign body with just topical anesthesia and very fine forceps. Also hydropulsion can work well. Occasionally will need to cut over the foreign body to retrieve it.
5. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca: A disease resulting in keratitis and conjunctivitis caused by a lack of aqueous tear production.

   * Diagnostics
     * Schirmer tear test, often have large amounts of mucopurulent exudate Treatment
     * See lecture on lacrimal disease 6. Indolent ulcers – see below
