# Ocular Pharmacology

## Ophthalmic medications
* Solutions: Safer if ocular integrity is questionable. Short contact time.
* Ointments: Cause severe uveitis if they enter the globe. Longer contact time.

## Pharmacology
* When possible choose antibiotic based on culture and sensitivity.
* While waiting on C and S try to base drug choice on cytology.
* Topical formulations can be made from IV preparations.
* Sometimes a stronger concentration may be desired than that available commercially, and fortified concentrations can be made.
* Oral antibiotics are indicated with perforation or impending perforation, eyelid disease, nasolacrimal disease, and vitreal infections (rare)

## Antibiotics

* Triple antibiotic contains neomycin, polymixin B and bacitracin (or gramicidin). This is used for routine prophylaxis.
    * Neomycin
        * Aminoglycoside
        * Bactericidal for many gram positive and gram negative organisms
    * Bacitracin or Gramicidin
        * Primarily is bactericidal against gram positive organisms
        * Resistance is rare
    * Polymixin B
        * Bactericidal against gram negative organisms
        * Development of resistance is unlikely

* Aminoglycosides
    * Basic spectrum is gram negative
    * Gentamicin, tobramycin
