#### Terms used in class

1. Morphologic diagnosis: This describes what morphologic structure is involved in the disease process, and what type of pathology is occurring. Some examples are ulcerative keratitis, anterior uveitis or retinal detachment. 
2. Etiologic diagnosis: This describes what is causing the morphologic diagnosis. Some examples are trauma, hypertension, blastomycosis, or entropion \(causing an ulcer\). There are many potential etiologic diagnoses for diseases such as corneal ulceration, and most are apparent on ophthalmic examination and need to be ruled in or out to make an etiologic diagnosis.
