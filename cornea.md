# Cornea

## Corneal Anatomy

### 3 General Layers

1. The outside layer is non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which is 5–7 layers. Epithelial turnover is every 7 days. The epithelium has a basement membrane that is basically insignificant clinically and histologically in veterinary medicine. This epithelial layer accounts for ~ 5% of the cornea’s thickness. The epithelium is divided into 3 layers.
    1. Basal cells - deepest layer, single cell thickness, attached to basement membrane via hemidesmosomes. Only epithelial layer to undergo mitosis.
    2. Wing cells - middle transitional layer between basal cells and squamous cells. 2-3 cells thick in dog.
    3. Squamous cells - Anterior layer, 2-3 cells thick in dog, microplicae and microvilli on surface help stabilize tear film, tight junctions between squamous cells limit permeability.
