# Cornea

## Corneal Anatomy

### 3 General Layers

1. The outside layer is non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which is 5–7 layers. Epithelial turnover is every 7 days. The epithelium has a basement membrane that is basically insignificant clinically and histologically in veterinary medicine. This epithelial layer accounts for ~ 5% of the cornea’s thickness. The epithelium is divided into 3 layers.
    1. Basal cells - deepest layer, single cell thickness, attached to basement membrane via hemidesmosomes. Only epithelial layer to undergo mitosis.
    2. Wing cells - middle transitional layer between basal cells and squamous cells. 2-3 cells thick in dog.
    3. Squamous cells - Anterior layer, 2-3 cells thick in dog, microplicae and microvilli on surface help stabilize tear film, tight junctions between squamous cells limit permeability.

2. The stroma makes up 90% of the corneal thickness. It is primarily collagen and GAGs and has low cellularity. The collagen in lamellae span corneal diameter. The stroma can take months to rebuild when damaged. The collagen is formed from keratocytes (modified fibroblasts). 90% of corneal thickness.

3. The endothelium and its basement membrane (Descemet’s membrane) make up the inside layer. Proliferative potential is very low. Single layer of hexagonal cells that are important in maintaining state of relative dehydration of cornea.

### Thickness
* The cornea is 0.5-0.6 mm thick in the dog and cat and about 1 mm in horses.
