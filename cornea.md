# Cornea

## Corneal Anatomy

### 3 General Layers

1. The outside layer is non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which is 5–7 layers. Epithelial turnover is every 7 days. The epithelium has a basement membrane that is basically insignificant clinically and histologically in veterinary medicine. This epithelial layer accounts for ~ 5% of the cornea’s thickness. The epithelium is divided into 3 layers.  
    1. Basal cells - deepest layer, single cell thickness, attached to basement membrane via hemidesmosomes. Only epithelial layer to undergo mitosis.  
    2. Wing cells - middle transitional layer between basal cells and squamous cells. 2-3 cells thick in dog.  
    3. Squamous cells - Anterior layer, 2-3 cells thick in dog, microplicae and microvilli on surface help stabilize tear film, tight junctions between squamous cells limit permeability.

2. The stroma makes up 90% of the corneal thickness. It is primarily collagen and GAGs and has low cellularity. The collagen in lamellae span corneal diameter. The stroma can take months to rebuild when damaged. The collagen is formed from keratocytes \(modified fibroblasts\). 90% of corneal thickness.

3. The endothelium and its basement membrane \(Descemet’s membrane\) make up the inside layer. Proliferative potential is very low. Single layer of hexagonal cells that are important in maintaining state of relative dehydration of cornea.

### Thickness

* The cornea is 0.5-0.6 mm thick in the dog and cat and about 1 mm in horses.

### Limbus

* The area where the edge of the cornea meets the conjunctiva and the sclera. When blood vessels invade the cornea, they begin from the limbus.

### Corneal innervation

* Via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Superficial injury is often more painful than deep as the pain receptors are superficial. Brachycephalics have fewer nerve branches than dolichocephalics and mesocephalics. Interestingly, this sensory innervation also provides factors necessary for corneal health \(e.g., a neuropeptide called Substance P\), and poor or disrupted innervation can lead to a syndrome called neurotrophic keratitis.

## Corneal Physiology

### Functions of the Cornea

* Supports intraocular contents
* Transmits light
* Refracts light \(40–42 diopters\)

### Corneal nutrition

* Aqueous humor
* Tears: major source of oxygen

### Mechanisms to maintain clarity
* Avascularity - Instead of using vasculature for its metabolic needs, the cornea uses aqueous humor and tears.
* No pigment
* Non-keratinized epithelium
* Highly organized arrangement of small diameter collagen fibrils- these fibrils extend the entire diameter of the cornea. This arrangement allows 99% of the light to pass through the cornea without scatter.
* Relative dehydration: Na -K- ATPase pumps in the endothelium and intercellular junctions between endothelial cells and epithelial cells remove and prevent fluid influx, respectively. The normal cornea is relatively dehydrated, containing about 70% water by weight (compared to 95+% for most tissues). This dehydration is an active process, as the cornea is bathed by fluid on both sides eager to enter – aqueous humor on the inside, and tears on the outside. In a normal cornea the endothelial cells constantly pump aqueous humor that has imbibed into the deeper stroma back into the anterior chamber, and the epithelial barriers keep tears out.
* Tear film: Prevents keratinization and washes away resident and transient bacteria so their numbers stay in check.

### Response to disease
* Edema: Occurs with damage to endothelium or loss of epithelium - glaucoma, ulceration, anterior uveitis, endothelial dystrophy, lens luxation. With corneal ulceration, the corneal edema is present because the missing epithelium cannot keep tears out, so they enter the stroma in the area of the ulcer causing a mild, faint edema. Whenever you see dense, widespread corneal edema, it is usually due to endothelial disease.
* Cellular infiltration: Immune mediated disease (pannus), neoplasia, WBC’s come in with infected corneal ulcers.
* Scar formation: Caused by abnormal arrangement of collagen fibers, often decreases with time, topical corticosteroids may lead to faster scar resolution. Recall that one of the reasons for corneal clarity is regular periodicity of the stromal collagen fibers. When collagen is secreted in the repair of a corneal stromal defect, the new collagen is laid down haphazardly and does not attain this regular periodicity. The result is an opacity.
* Pigmentation: Can occur with any chronic irritation, can be associated with active or inactive disease.
* Vascularization: Corneal vessels grow 1-2 mm per day. They take about a week to get started. Indicates active chronic disease. When the cornea is injured or inflamed, the metabolic needs change. The cornea then recruits vessels from an arcade of limbal vessels to meet these changing metabolic needs. Superficial vessels develop in response to superficial keratitis, and deeper vessels develop in response to either deep corneal disease or intraocular diseases such as uveitis and glaucoma. Superficial vessels are usually solitary vessels that branch dichotomously and often extend far into the cornea. Deep vessels form more of a “brush border,” with multiple short straight vessels densely packed together; these vessels usually don’t make it to the center of the cornea. As the keratitis resolves, the cornea’s need for a blood supply diminishes. The endothelial channel that had formed within the cornea then collapses, but the “track” that it laid down remains, and appears as a translucent line within the cornea. These are referred to as ghost vessels.
* Secondary uveitis: Results from an axonal nerve reflex in the trigeminal nerve and is referred to as axon reflex uveitis. Anterior uveitis means inflammation of the iris and ciliary body. This axon reflex mechanism causes signs of anterior uveitis including: protein and cellular leakage from uveal blood vessels (aqueous flare), ciliary spasm (resulting in pain) and pupillary miosis.

### Mechanisms of corneal healing
* Epithelial defects: When corneal epithelial cells sense a loss of “contact inhibition,” the basal epithelial cells will slide across the bare corneal stroma. Fibronectin is laid down on the stromal surface, and fibronectin receptors on the basal aspect of the basal epithelial cells attach to these receptors, then “ratchet” across the stroma using actin and myosin filaments. Once the stroma is covered, the epithelial cells undergo mitosis to thicken back to the normal 7-8 cell thickness. An entire cornea can reepithelialize in 4-7 days.
* Stromal defects
    * Avascular healing: Neutrophils come in via chemotaxis. The local keratocytes die. Surrounding keratocytes “transform” into fibrocytes, migrate, synthesize collagen and mucopolysaccharides. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes produced by both the cornea and the invading PMNs degrade necrotic tissue in a relatively controlled fashion. The epithelium migrates to cover the defect. Maximum wound strength is achieved in 6-12 months.
    * Vascular healing: Cellular infiltrate is greater. Vessels invade the stroma and granulation tissue is created. The scar is denser than with avascular healing. Eventually the vessels collapse and become ghost vessels.
